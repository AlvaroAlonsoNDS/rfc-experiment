# RFC 000

## Background

Our team needs a way to record technical decisions and ways of working. This team might be in charge of multiple services and ownership might change therefore we it would be idea

## Proposal

We use this space to record all the decisions that relate to the teams ways of working but leave all the services related RFCs into their own space

## Impact

- Changes in service ownership do not require to move documents around
- Team specific decisions are recorded and easy to find for context
